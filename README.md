# Meraki

## Event Description

**Meraki** was a Capture the Flag (CTF) event organized by *Zer01coded*, NIT Puducherry's coding club, as part of Freshers' 23. It provided an opportunity for students to showcase their aptitude and problem-solving skills within a community of passionate coders.
The event was structured into multiple stages of increasing difficulty, with each stage comprising puzzles related to various computer science concepts. Participants had to solve all puzzles within a stage to obtain a "flag," which was a prerequisite to advance to the next stage. Importantly, the event was strictly "no-code," allowing students from any department and experience level to participate.
